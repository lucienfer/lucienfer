# 👋 Hi, I’m Lucien Fernandez

I'm an independent developer building tools and systems at the intersection of performance, decentralization and cryptography.

Currently focused on:
- ⚙️ **Rust** – for its control, safety, and expressiveness
- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** – especially with **Noir**
- 🧠 **Systems Thinking & Architecture** – to deeply understand how things work and fit together

---

## 📚 Currently Learning

- 🧩 **Merkle Trees** & low-level ZK building blocks  
- ➗ **Elliptic Curves** and cryptographic primitives  
- 🔧 **Rust internals**, memory layout and performance optimization  
- 🧠 Deep work & learning strategies to sharpen long-term focus

---

## 🛠 Projects

🔧 **[git-branch-cleaner](https://github.com/lucienfer/git-branch-cleaner)**  
A CLI tool to clean up merged Git branches – currently WIP.

🧮 **[computor-v1](https://github.com/lucienfer/computor-v1)**  
A small interpreter solving polynomials (up to degree 2), written in Rust for learning parsing and symbolic math.

🧪 More coming soon – including ZK experiments.

## 💡 Philosophy

I care about:
- Clean, composable, and readable code
- Understanding systems from the ground up
- Building tools that feel **solid and elegant**
