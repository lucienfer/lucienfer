# 👋 Hi, I’m Lucien Fernandez

I'm an independent developer building tools and systems at the intersection of performance, decentralized infrastructure, and agent-based design.

Currently focused on:
- ⚙️ **Rust** – for its control, safety, and expressiveness  
- 📜 **Smart Contracts** – building secure and composable protocols  
- 🕸 **Agent-Based Systems** – distributed coordination and autonomous logic

---

## 🛠 Projects & Contributions

🧠 **[SNAK](https://github.com/KasarLabs/snak)**  
Added **agentic tools** to interact with a smart contract and to **generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs** using the **Herodotus API**.

🔐 **[Paynet](https://github.com/nutty-raccoon/paynet)**  
A decentralized invoice payment system – added security checks and logic to prevent misuse and invalid payments.

🧮 **[computor-v1](https://github.com/lucienfer/computor-v1)**  
A small interpreter solving polynomials (up to degree 2), written in Rust to explore parsing and symbolic math – still under development.

🧹 **[git-branch-cleaner](https://github.com/lucienfer/git-branch-cleaner)**  
CLI tool to remove merged Git branches – still under development.

## 📚 Currently Learning

- 🕹 **Agent design patterns** & decentralized coordination  
- ➗ **Elliptic curves** and cryptographic primitives  
- 🧵 **Rust internals**, memory layout and performance  
- 🧠 Deep work & learning strategies to sharpen long-term focus

---

## 💡 Philosophy

I care about:
- Clean, composable, and readable code  
- Understanding systems from the ground up  
- Building tools that feel **solid and elegant**
